Digital Escape Game Product. 
Done in Scrum with a Sprint of two weeks . 

                                                   *** Scrum Team of six people *** 
 
 # Concept of the Game
 
 Behind Closed Doors is an escape game in Javascript where the player will have to solve enigmas and mysteries to unlock rooms and progress deeper in the game. The concept of the game is to bring to the User an experience that will be enlightning and different from your everyday escape game. The six rooms all have their own concept from the early memories of your childhood to the more dark adult world we all fear. 
             Be careful though! for amongst the many secrets another one is hiding.
